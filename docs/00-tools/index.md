# IDEs for This Course

A good IDE makes Java work smoother. The course recommends Eclipse, but IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code are also fine. Pick what feels comfortable and runs well on your computer.

## Your options
- Eclipse (recommended): Free, reliable, and well-suited for learning. Strong Java support, debugging, and project tools.
- IntelliJ IDEA: Polished experience and powerful features. Community Edition is free; Ultimate is paid.
- NetBeans: Simple to set up with solid Java and Maven support out of the box.
- VS Code: Lightweight editor that becomes a Java IDE with the Java Extension Pack.

## Why we recommend Eclipse
Eclipse gives a common setup for everyone, is easy to work with, and is fully capable for the course. It works well on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and has everything needed for projects, debugging, and refactoring.

## Can I use something else?
Yes. All course materials and projects work in any of the IDEs above. If unsure, start with Eclipse. Switching later is easy once the basics are in place.

## Next steps
- New to Java tools? [Install Eclipse](./eclipse-setup.md) first and run a short `Hello, World` to confirm your setup.
- Comfortable with another IDE? Use it. Just make sure a recent JDK (e.g., Java 21) is installed and selected in the IDE settings.
