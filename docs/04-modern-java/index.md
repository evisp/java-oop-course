# Modern Java Overview

Learn the newer Java features that make your code cleaner and more powerful. Use **generic collections** for type safety, lambdas and streams for better data processing, and JavaFX to create desktop applications with visual interfaces.

## [Generic Collections](./generic-collections.md)

**Type-safe collections**

Learn how to use Java Collections (like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`) with generic types (like `List<Customer>` and `Map<Integer, Customer>`) so the compiler can catch type errors early and you don’t need unsafe casts.

**You'll learn:** `List<T>`, `Set<T>`, `Map<K,V>`, diamond operator (`<>`), iterating safely over typed collections, and avoiding raw types in collection-based programs.

## [Lambdas & Streams](./lambdas-streams.md)

**Functional programming in Java**

Use lambda expressions and the Stream API to process collections more efficiently. Replace long loops with short, clear operations for filtering, mapping, and reducing data in your programs.

**You'll learn:** Lambda syntax, functional interfaces, stream operations like map/filter/reduce, method references, and processing data collections effectively.

## [JavaFX & GUI](./javafx-gui.md)

**Build desktop applications**

Create desktop programs with graphical interfaces using JavaFX. Build interactive applications with buttons, text fields, layouts, and event handling for user-friendly software.

**You'll learn:** JavaFX components, scene structure, event handling, layouts, styling with CSS, and building complete desktop applications.

***

**Start here:** Begin with Generic Collections to understand type safety, then learn Lambdas & Streams for data processing. Finish with JavaFX & GUI to build visual applications. Complete the [exercises](exercises.md) after each topic—these features will make your Java code more effective and modern.
