# Modern Java Overview

Learn the newer Java features that make your code cleaner and more powerful. Use generics for type safety, lambdas and streams for better data processing, and JavaFX to create desktop applications with visual interfaces.

## [Generics](./generics.md)

**Type-safe, reusable code**

Learn Java's generics to write code that works with different types while catching errors at compile time. Create classes and methods that can handle multiple data types safely without casting or runtime errors.

**You'll learn:** Generic classes and methods, type parameters, wildcards, and building components that work with different data types safely

## [Lambdas & Streams](./lambdas-streams.md)

**Functional programming in Java**

Use lambda expressions and the Stream API to process collections more efficiently. Replace long loops with short, clear operations for filtering, mapping, and reducing data in your programs.

**You'll learn:** Lambda syntax, functional interfaces, stream operations like map/filter/reduce, method references, and processing data collections effectively

## [JavaFX & GUI](./javafx-gui.md)

**Build desktop applications**

Create desktop programs with graphical interfaces using JavaFX. Build interactive applications with buttons, text fields, layouts, and event handling for user-friendly software.

**You'll learn:** JavaFX components, scene structure, event handling, layouts, styling with CSS, and building complete desktop applications

***

**Start here:** Begin with Generics to understand type safety, then learn Lambdas & Streams for data processing. Finish with JavaFX & GUI to build visual applications. Complete the [exercises](exercises.md) after each topicâ€”these features will make your Java code more effective and modern.
