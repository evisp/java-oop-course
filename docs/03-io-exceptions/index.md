# File and Exception Handling Overview

Build robust applications that handle errors gracefully and work with external data. Learn to manage exceptions and interact with the file system using streams and modern I/O techniques.

## [Exception Handling](./exception-handling.md)

**Write bulletproof code**

Master Java's exception handling system to create applications that recover from errors instead of crashing. Learn try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices for defensive programming.

**You'll learn:** Try-catch-finally blocks, checked vs unchecked exceptions, throwing custom exceptions, and error handling strategies

## [Files & Streams](./files-streams.md)

**Connect to the outside world**

Work with files and directories using Java's I/O system. Understand byte streams, character streams, buffered I/O, and modern file operations for reading and writing data efficiently.

**You'll learn:** FileInputStream/FileOutputStream, FileReader/FileWriter, buffered streams, and when to use each approach for different file operations

***

**Start here:** Begin with Exception Handling to understand error management, then move to Files & Streams to work with external data. Complete the [exercises](exercises.md) after both topicsâ€”these skills are essential for real-world applications that must handle unexpected situations and persistent data.
