# Java Object-Oriented Programming Course

Learn modern Java OOP by building. Clear concepts, practical examples, and projects that develop real programming skills.

## Who it's for
- Students (at University Metropolitan Tirana) learning object-oriented programming concepts.
- Developers comfortable with basic programming who want to master Java OOP.
- Anyone seeking a structured approach to Java without unnecessary complexity.

## What's inside

**[Foundations](01-foundations/index.md)**: Build your OOP foundation with classes, objects, collections, and object-oriented thinking.

**[Core OOP Principles](02-core-oop/index.md)**: Master inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstract programming.

**[File and Exception Handling](03-io-exceptions/index.md)**: Write robust applications that handle errors and work with external data.

**[Modern Java](04-modern-java/index.md)**: Use generics, lambdas, streams, and JavaFX for contemporary Java development.

**[Projects](projects/index.md)**: Apply your knowledge through progressive sprints and a capstone project.

**[Resources](resources/index.md)**: Reference materials, tools, and extended learning resources.

## Suggested path
- Foundations first: Introduction to OOP → Classes & Objects → Arrays & Collections → Thinking in Objects.
- Core principles: Inheritance → Polymorphism → Encapsulation → Abstract Classes & Interfaces.
- Practical skills: Exception Handling → Files & Streams.
- Modern features: Generics → Lambdas & Streams → JavaFX & GUI.
- Build projects throughout to reinforce learning.

## Study tips
- Code every example yourself - reading code is not the same as writing it.
- Complete the exercises in each section before moving forward.
- Start each project sprint when you finish the related concepts.
- Explain concepts to others - teaching reveals what you truly understand.

## Word of encouragement

Object-oriented programming changes how you think about code. Start simple, practice consistently, and build real projects.

When concepts feel abstract, write more code. When projects feel overwhelming, return to the fundamentals and take smaller steps.

Every expert was once a beginner. Keep coding, keep building, keep learning.
