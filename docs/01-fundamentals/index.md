## [Introduction to OOP](./intro-oop.md)

**From procedures to objects**

Understand why object-oriented programming dictates how we structure code. Learn the fundamental shift from writing step-by-step procedures to modeling real-world entities as objects with properties and behaviors.

**You'll learn:** Why OOP matters, the core principles that guide object design, and how to think in terms of objects rather than functions

## [Classes & Objects](./classes-objects.md)

**Blueprints and instances**

Master the building blocks of Java OOP. Create your first classes, instantiate objects, define constructors, and understand how objects interact through methods and fields.

**You'll learn:** How to design classes, create objects, write constructors and methods, and manage object state

## [Arrays & Collections](./arrays-lists.md)

**Managing groups of data**

Work with collections of objects using arrays and ArrayList. Learn when to use each approach and how to store, access, and manipulate groups of related data efficiently.

**You'll learn:** Array fundamentals, ArrayList operations, choosing the right collection type, and iterating through data

## [Thinking in Objects](./thinking-objects.md)

**The object-oriented mindset**

Develop the problem-solving approach that distinguishes object-oriented design. Learn to identify objects in real-world problems, define their responsibilities, and model relationships between them.

**You'll learn:** How to decompose problems into objects, assign responsibilities, and design clean object interactions
