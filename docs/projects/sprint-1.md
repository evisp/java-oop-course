## Goal
Turn a real-world use case into a minimal, working OOP skeleton that models key entities and relationships using classes, objects, and collections, supported by a class diagram and short documentation.

> Emphasize Foundations: Fundamentals of OOP, Classes and Objects, Arrays/Lists, and Thinking in Objects, ensuring clear encapsulation and basic interactions between objects.

## Key elements
| Element | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Topics covered | Fundamentals of OOP, Classes & Objects, Arrays/Lists, Thinking in Objects. |
| Teams | 2–4 students per team; team must remain the same for all sprints. |
| Points | Semester project: 30 points; Sprint 1: 10 points. |
| Deadline | November 4 (end of day). |
| Submission | One team submission: repository link (or ZIP) containing requirements brief, class diagram (PNG/PDF), and the code developed. |
| Point distribution | Project defense 3 pts, Class Diagram 2 pts, Core Classes 4 pts, Documentation 1 pt. |


## What to deliver

You must deliver **one zipped folder per group that contains all Sprint 1 materials**. The zipped folder must include

- **Two-page document**: include the project goal, a concise list of key expected functionalities, and a requirements brief mapping core user actions to initial entities and relationships for Sprint 1 scope, with an embedded UML class diagram showing classes, key attributes, and associations/multiplicities
- **Source code**: implement 2–3 core classes with constructors, fields, and methods that collaborate using at least one collection (for example, a List) to demonstrate encapsulation and basic object interactions reflective of the Foundations topics.


## Project ideas

> Choose a project your team finds interesting and useful, and make sure it directly uses the key topics we are focusing on right now: OOP, Collections, and Thinking in Objects.

Keep Sprint 1 small and focused: define a few real-world entities as classes, show how they relate, and use lists or other collections to support simple actions and data flows.

Write clean, readable code and include a simple class diagram; advanced features can wait for later sprints once your foundation is solid and easy to extend.
Below are some suggested ideas to get you started.


### University Management System: 
Start with Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollments so you can add students to courses and list who is enrolled where. Keep it simple: create the core classes and basic methods to enroll and view enrollments, using a list to store relationships. Later sprints can add grading, schedules, or departments after the basics work well.

### Library Management System
Start with Books, Members, and Loans so you can check out and return books and see what is available. Keep it simple: create the core classes and a list of current loans to track availability and due dates at a basic level. Later sprints can add reservations, fines, or reports once the core flow is stable.

### Attendance Management System
Start with Users, Sessions, and AttendanceRecords so you can mark attendance and list who attended which session. Keep it simple: create the core classes and use a list or map to store records, with a minimal difference between admin, faculty, and student roles for now. Later sprints can add summaries and filters by date or course after the basics work
