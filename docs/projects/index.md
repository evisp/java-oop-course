# Projects Overview

Apply your Java OOP knowledge through progressive building projects. Each sprint focuses on specific concepts, building from simple applications to complex systems that showcase your programming skills.

## [Sprint 1 - Early Concepts](./sprint-1.md)

**Build your first object-oriented application**

Create a simple program using classes, objects, and basic collections. Focus on proper class design, object creation, and managing data with arrays or ArrayList. This sprint reinforces foundation concepts through practical coding.

**You'll build:** A basic application like a student management system, library catalog, or inventory tracker using fundamental OOP concepts

## [Sprint 2 - OOP Principles](./sprint-2.md)

**Design with inheritance and polymorphism**

Expand your application using inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and polymorphic behavior. Implement proper encapsulation with access modifiers and create abstract classes or interfaces for flexible design.

**You'll build:** An extended version of your Sprint 1 project with class hierarchies, specialized subclasses, and polymorphic method calls

## [Sprint 3 - Advanced Integration](./sprint-3.md)

**Handle real-world challenges**

Add robust error handling with exceptions and persistent data storage using file I/O. Integrate multiple advanced concepts to create a complete, professional application that handles unexpected situations gracefully.

**You'll build:** A full-featured application with exception handling, file persistence, and advanced OOP design patterns

## [Final Project](./final-project.md)

**Showcase your mastery**

Design and implement a comprehensive Java application that demonstrates all course concepts. Include modern Java features like generics, lambdas, and optionally a graphical interface. This capstone project shows your complete OOP programming skills.

**You'll build:** A substantial application of your choice that incorporates the full range of Java OOP techniques learned throughout the course

***

**Start here:** Begin Sprint 1 after completing the Foundations section. Work through each sprint in order, as they build upon previous work. Take time to plan your application design before codingâ€”good planning makes implementation smoother and more successful.
