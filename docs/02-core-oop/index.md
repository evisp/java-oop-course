# Core OOP Principles Overview

Master the four pillars that define object-oriented programming. Build robust, maintainable systems using inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction with clear examples and practical applications.

## [Abstraction and Encapsulation](./encapsulation.md)

**Control access and protect data**

Master the practice of bundling data and methods while controlling access through visibility modifiers. Learn to create clean interfaces using getters, setters, and proper data hiding techniques.

**You'll learn:** Access modifiers, getter/setter methods, data validation, and maintaining object integrity

## [Inheritance and Polymorphism](./inheritance-polymorphism.md)

**Extend and specialize classes**

Learn to create class hierarchies where child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes. Master super and subclass relationships, method overriding, and the IS-A relationship that models real-world specialization.


**One interface, many forms**

Understand how objects of different types can be treated uniformly through method overriding and dynamic binding. Write flexible code that works with multiple object types using the same interface.

**You'll learn:** How to extend classes, override methods, use super keyword, and design effective class hierarchies. In addition, you will also learn method overriding, runtime polymorphism, casting objects, and designing adaptable systems



## [Abstract Classes & Interfaces](./abstract-interfaces.md)

**Define contracts and common behavior**

Create abstract classes that provide partial implementations and interfaces that define pure contracts. Learn when to use each approach and how they enable flexible, extensible designs.

**You'll learn:** Abstract classes vs interfaces, implementing contracts, multiple inheritance through interfaces, and designing flexible systems

**Start here:** Begin with Inheritance to understand class relationships, then move through Polymorphism and Encapsulation. Finish with Abstract Classes & Interfaces to see how these principles work together. Complete the [exercises](exercises.md) after each topic to reinforce the concepts—these principles build on each other.
