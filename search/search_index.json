Traditional programming approaches using separate variables and functions quickly become inefficient when dealing with complex, interconnected data like customer profiles linked to multiple accounts with different balances and transaction histories.</p> <p>Object-oriented programming provides an elegant solution by letting you model real-world entities directly in code.

Today, you'll create <code>Customer</code> and <code>Account</code> classes that interact naturally.</p> <p>Through this practical project, you will learn the core building blocks of object-oriented programming: how to define classes as blueprints for objects, use constructors to create properly initialized objects, implement encapsulation with getters and setters to protect sensitive data, and override the <code>toString()</code> method for clear object representation. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"01-fundamentals/classes-objects/#the-blueprint-concept-understanding-classes","title":"The Blueprint Concept - Understanding Classes","text":"<p>Think of a class as an architect's blueprint for a house.
